            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi there! I'm Alok Kumar, a driven and committed third-year student pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science engineering. I have developed a strong interest in full-stack web development and am proficient in a number of programming languages, including Python and Java. I have actively participated in a number of projects that have improved my abilities and broadened my knowledge of software development during my academic career. I take pleasure in using coding and problem-solving to turn concepts into reality. <br>I had the honour of winning a hackathon at my college the year before, which demonstrated my capacity for creativity and using technology to solve practical issues. My enthusiasm for creativity and teamwork in problem-solving was further stoked by my honourable nomination for the Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2023. <br>Along with my technical expertise, I also have excellent interpersonal and collaborative skills, which have been very helpful when working on different projects with peers and mentors. I aspire to keep up with the most recent advancements in computer science technology and trends because I firmly believe in lifelong learning. <br>The idea of using my abilities to further worthwhile projects and have a positive influence excites me. Please look through my portfolio to see more of my projects and work.
            <br>Thank you for visiting!

                    <h3>Urban Biome: Empowering Urban Planners for Greener Cities</h3>
                    <p>"Urban Biome" is an innovative project aimed at addressing the challenges urban planners face in identifying optimal locations for green spaces in cities. It combines environmental analysis, community input, and advanced technologies to create data-driven solutions for sustainable urban development. The Urban Biome project leverages a robust tech stack to deliver powerful insights and visualization capabilities. GIS data is used for spatial analysis, enabling precise mapping of urban regions and green spaces. The project employs Leaflet.js, a lightweight JavaScript library, to create interactive and user-friendly maps that allow planners to explore environmental data dynamically. Machine learning, specifically the Random Forest algorithm, is utilized to evaluate critical environmental factors such as soil quality, elevation, and air quality, generating a comprehensive "Green Score" for each location. This analysis is supported by a cloud-based infrastructure, ensuring scalability, real-time data access, and seamless integration of additional datasets or cities. Together, these technologies form a cohesive system that empowers urban planners to make data-driven decisions while fostering sustainable development.</p>
